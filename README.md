This is a Spring security project with Registration and login. In the case that one may want to use spring security 
without an authorization server like Jira/Firebase this is a perfect starting point.

Tell me what you think. I share this code because I know Spring security has a steep learning curve and a simple 
straight forwad tutorial or code base is important.
